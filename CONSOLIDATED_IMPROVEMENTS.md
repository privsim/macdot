# Cleaned Up macOS Provisioning Improvements

## Summary of Changes

After reviewing your existing setup and removing redundancies, here are the consolidated improvements:

### 1. **Consolidated Brewfile** (`install/Brewfile.consolidated`)
- Kept all your existing packages
- Added only essential new tools:
  - `asdf` - Unified version manager (replaces multiple version managers)
  - `gnupg` & `pinentry-mac` - GPG for commit signing
  - `age` - Modern encryption tool
  - `direnv` - Per-project environment variables
  - `lazygit` - Excellent Git TUI
  - `mkcert` - Local HTTPS certificates
  - `eza` - Modern replacement for ls
  - `procs` - Better ps command
  - `bottom` - Modern system monitor
  - `duf` - Better disk usage
  - `mas` - Mac App Store CLI
  - `warp` - Modern terminal (cask)
  - `orbstack` - Better Docker Desktop alternative (cask)

### 2. **Additional macOS Defaults** (`macos/defaults-additional.sh`)
- Only includes settings NOT in your existing defaults.sh
- Performance optimizations
- Developer tool enhancements
- Security improvements
- No duplicates with your current setup

### 3. **Defaults Verification Tool** (`macos/verify-defaults.sh`)
- Tests macOS defaults commands before applying
- Helps identify which settings are valid for your macOS version
- Color-coded output for easy reading

## Your Existing zmeta Setup

Your `.zmeta` directory shows a sophisticated zsh configuration:
- Using zinit for plugin management
- Platform-specific configurations (darwin-arm64)
- Custom functions and aliases
- Extensive bin directory with custom scripts

## Integration Recommendations

1. **Version Management**:
   ```bash
   # Replace 'n' with asdf for all languages
   brew install asdf
   asdf plugin add nodejs
   asdf plugin add python
   asdf plugin add ruby
   ```

2. **Apply Only New Packages**:
   ```bash
   # Test what would be installed
   brew bundle --file=install/Brewfile.consolidated --dry-run
   
   # Or just install the new additions
   brew install asdf gnupg pinentry-mac age direnv lazygit mkcert eza procs bottom duf mas
   brew install --cask warp orbstack
   ```

3. **Verify and Apply Additional Settings**:
   ```bash
   # First verify what settings are valid
   ./macos/verify-defaults.sh
   
   # Then apply additional settings
   ./macos/defaults-additional.sh
   ```

## Removed Redundancies

The following were removed as they duplicated existing functionality:
- Multiple enhanced versions of existing files
- Duplicate package definitions
- Settings already in your defaults.sh
- Tools you already have equivalents for

## Key Improvements to Consider

1. **asdf over n**: More unified, handles all languages
2. **lazygit**: Significantly improves git workflow
3. **direnv**: Essential for per-project configurations
4. **eza**: Drop-in replacement for ls with better defaults
5. **orbstack**: Much faster than Docker Desktop

## Cleanup

To remove all the redundant files created during exploration:
```bash
./cleanup-redundant.sh
```

This will remove all the duplicate enhancement files, keeping only the consolidated improvements.
