# Done. Your setup is perfect as-is.

Run this to apply all your settings:

```bash
cd /Users/lclose/mac_provision/macdot
dot macos   # Sets all your macOS preferences including LIGHTNING FAST keys
dot dock    # Sets up your minimal dock
```

That's it. 

Your `defaults.sh` already has:
- KeyRepeat set to 1 (fastest possible)
- InitialKeyRepeat set to 15 (minimal delay)
- Everything else configured exactly how you had it

Nothing was broken. Just run those two commands.
